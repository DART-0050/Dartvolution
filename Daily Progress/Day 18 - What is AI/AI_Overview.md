### Human Capabilities and AI Fields

#### Communication and Language

- **Speech Recognition** (Statistical Learning)
  - Humans can speak and listen to communicate through language
  - Much of speech recognition is statistically based
  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - Humans can write and read text in a language
  - Enables machines to understand and process human language

#### Vision and Perception

- **Computer Vision**
  - Humans can see with their eyes and process what they see
  - Falls under the symbolic way for computers to process information
  - Recently, new approaches have emerged
  
- **Image Processing**
  - Humans recognize scenes through their eyes which create images
  - Not directly related to AI but required for computer vision

#### Movement and Environment

- **Robotics**
  - Humans can understand their environment and move around fluidly
  - Enables machines to interact with the physical world

#### Pattern Recognition

- **Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning**
  - Humans can see patterns (grouping of like objects)
  - Machines are even better at pattern recognition because they can:
    - Use more data
    - Process higher dimensions of data
  - This is the field of machine learning

### Neural Networks and Deep Learning

#### Human Brain Structure

- The human brain is a network of neurons
- We use these neurons to learn things
- If we can replicate the structure and function of the human brain, we might achieve cognitive capabilities in machines

#### Neural Networks

- **Basic Neural Networks:** Replicate brain structure and function
- **Deep Learning:** More complex and deeper networks that learn complex things

#### Types of Deep Learning Networks

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
  - Networks that scan images from left to right, top to bottom
  - Used to recognize objects in a scene
  - How computer vision and object recognition is accomplished through AI

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
  - Humans can remember the past (like what you had for dinner last night)
  - Neural networks that can remember a limited past

---

### Two Approaches to AI

#### 1. Symbolic-Based AI

- Traditional approach to AI processing

#### 2. Data-Based AI (Machine Learning)

- Requires feeding the machine lots of data before it can learn
- **Example:** Sales vs. advertising spend data
  - Plot data to see patterns
  - Machine learns patterns and makes predictions
  - Machines can learn in many more dimensions (hundreds or thousands)
  - Can look at high-dimensional data and determine patterns humans can't

---

### Machine Learning Applications

#### Two Main Uses

1. **Classification**
   - Using information about customers to assign new customers to groups
   - Example: Classifying customers as "young adults"

2. **Prediction**
   - Using data to predict future outcomes
   - Example: Predicting if customers are likely to defect to a competitor

---

### Types of Learning Algorithms

#### 1. Supervised Learning

- Train algorithm with data that contains the answer
- **Example:** Training a machine to recognize your friends by name
- You need to identify them for the computer during training

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- Train algorithm with data where you want the machine to figure out patterns
- **Example:** Feed data about celestial objects and expect the machine to find patterns by itself

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning

- Give algorithm a goal and expect it to achieve that goal through trial-and-error
- **Example:** Robot attempting to climb over a wall until it succeeds

## Image Generation - Diffusion Models **(01:28-02:10)**

### How Diffusion Models Work

- Start with random noise
- Gradually refine image step-by-step
- Use **U-Net architectures**
- Process:
  1. Add noise to training images
  2. Train model to reconstruct original from noisy version
  3. Learn to predict and remove noise at each step
  4. Generate high-quality, realistic images
