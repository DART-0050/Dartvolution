# Day 2 â€“ Git & GitHub Mastery

This repo tracks my deep dive into Git and GitHub as part of my **Darvolution** learning journey. 

I followed [this YouTube guide](https://youtu.be/S7XpTAnSDL4?si=LSAqEi_IW3e5VDxT), practiced commands hands-on, took notes, and set up a dedicated repository [mastering_git](https://github.com/DART-0050/mastering_git) to explore branching, merging, and conflict resolution like a pro ðŸ§ ðŸ’».

## What I Did

- Watched an in-depth Git & GitHub tutorial
- Practiced all major Git workflows in a new repo
- Took clean notes on Git essentials and conflict resolution
- Learned how to use branches, pull requests, merge, stash,reset and revert
- Gained confidence in handling version control

## My Notes

I took down some important steps in the process of learning Git.

### BASIC STEPS INVOLVED IN GIT

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create a new branch from main or another branch  
3. Make your changes  
4. Add the modified files  
5. Push the branch to the remote repository  
6. Open a pull request  
7. Merge the changes  
8. Pull the merged changes into your local main branch

### RESOLVING MERGE CONFLICTS

A merge conflict occurs when two or more users modify the same file and attempt to merge it into the main branch simultaneously. Follow these steps to resolve the conflict:

1. Switch to the `main` branch  
2. Pull the latest changes from the remote main  
3. Switch to your working branch  
4. Run `git merge main` (since the reverse caused the conflict)  
5. Review, accept or reject conflicting changes  
6. Add the file, commit, and push  
7. Conflict resolved!
