## ✨ Topics Covered

- 🔹 Introduction to Seaborn
- 🔹 Basic plots: `lineplot`, `scatterplot`, `barplot`, `countplot`
- 🔹 Distribution plots: `distplot`, `histplot`, `kdeplot`
- 🔹 Categorical plots: `boxplot`, `violinplot`, `stripplot`
- 🔹 Customizing plots using `hue`, `style`, `palette`
- 🔹 Working with real-world datasets (e.g., retail data, tips dataset)
- 🔹 Combining Pandas and Seaborn for deeper insights
