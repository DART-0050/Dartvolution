## Introduction to Neural Networks

- Neural networks are powerful machine learning models capable of modeling complex, non-linear relationships.
- Often seen as "black boxes" due to their internal complexity.
- The goal is to demystify their structure and behavior step-by-step.

## Why Use Neural Networks?

- Traditional linear models fail to fit complex patterns in data.
- Neural networks can create flexible, non-linear functions (e.g., squiggles).
- Example: Predicting drug dosage effectiveness — low and high ineffective, medium effective.

## Neural Network Structure

### Components

- **Nodes (Neurons)**: Units that apply a transformation to input data.
- **Connections**: Carry signals between nodes and are associated with parameters (weights and biases).

### Layers

- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data (e.g., drug dosage).
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform intermediate transformations.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the prediction (e.g., effective or not).

## Activation Functions

- Add non-linearity to the model.
- Common types:
  - **Softplus**: Smooth curve, used in this video.
  - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Common in practice.
  - **Sigmoid**: Historically used, bounded between 0 and 1.
- Each node uses an activation function to generate its output.

## Simple Neural Network Example

### Setup

- 1 input node (dosage)
- 1 output node (effectiveness)
- 2 hidden nodes

### Flow of Computation

1. Multiply input by weight, add bias → input to activation function
2. Apply activation function (Softplus)
3. Multiply result by another weight → scaled activation
4. Add outputs of hidden nodes
5. Apply final bias shift to produce output

### Example Calculation

- Top hidden node: `softplus(-34.4 × dosage + 2.14)` → blue curve
- Bottom hidden node: `softplus(-2.52 × dosage + 1.29)` → orange curve
- Scaled and summed → green squiggle (prediction function)
- For dosage = 0.5 → predicted output ≈ 1.03 → interpreted as "effective"

## Terminology

- **Weights**: Multipliers on connections
- **Biases**: Values added after multiplication
- **Activation Function**: The bent or curved line applied to inputs at each node
- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that enable the network to learn complex patterns

## Why It Works

- Even with simple architecture, neural networks can model non-linear data
- More layers and nodes allow more complex function approximation
- Each hidden node transforms the activation function in a unique way

## Closing Thoughts

- Neural networks are essentially squiggle fitting machines
- With proper understanding, their behavior becomes more transparent and intuitive
- Future videos will cover parameter fitting with backpropagation and deep learning
