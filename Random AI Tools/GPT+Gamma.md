## Core Problem

- **AI presentation tools fail at insight generation** - they're great at creating slides but can't uncover what actually matters
- Gap between insight generation and presentation

## 3-Step Solution Framework

### Step 1: Research Phase (ChatGPT/Gemini)

- Use **deep research feature** with latest reasoning model
- Requires specific, comprehensive prompts
- Focus on **recommendations, not just research**
- Use consulting frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, etc.)
- Ask for ranked scorecards with clear priorities

### Step 2: Structure Phase (AI)

- Transform research into compelling story
- Use frameworks like **SEQA** (Situation, Evaluation, Question, Answer)
- Package facts to convince decision-makers
- Focus on decreasing decision fatigue

### Step 3: Design Phase (Gamma)

- Copy structured outline to Gamma
- Choose condensed text + detailed content
- Use professional themes
- Refine with "edit with AI" feature
- Add visuals, icons, and formatting

## Key Features & Tips

### Gamma Strengths

- **Spotlight mode** - blurs slides until clicked
- Easy image/icon integration
- Brand guidelines import
- Quick layout changes

### Gamma Limitations

- Export formatting issues to Google Slides
- Free version has watermarks
- Not perfect for complex charts

## Critical Insights

1. **Tool Matching**: Use right tool for right job
   - Deep research → Insights
   - Text models → Story structure
   - Gamma → Visualization

2. **Human Judgment Still Essential**
   - AI handles execution, humans provide strategy
   - Review for flow and critical information

3. **Collaboration Over Control**
   - Don't surrender entirely to AI
   - Don't cling to manual workflows
   - Find optimal collaboration points

## Pro Tips

- Custom GPT available for generating detailed research prompts
- Always check for smooth presentation flow
- Verify no critical insights were lost in generation
- Use specific, actionable recommendations over generic research
